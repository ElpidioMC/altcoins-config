## About Electrumx

The server code is open source, anyone can run a server. There are several implementations.

Public Electrum servers run by strangers can easily spy on Electrum users. For this reason many people run their own server. For maximum trustlessness, privacy and security; users should point Electrum to their own servers.

ElectrumX is the latest iteration of general purpose Electrum servers. Written in python, it tries to be as efficient as possible to keep synchronization times low. ElectrumX is able to serve thousands of clients at once, it is suited to be an always-on server that contributes to bitcoin.
